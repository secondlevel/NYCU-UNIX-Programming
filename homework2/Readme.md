# Monitor File Activities of Dynamically Linked Programs

In this homework, we aim to practice library injection and API hijacking. Please implement a simple logger program that can show file-access-related activities of an arbitrary binary running on a Linux operating system. You have to implement your logger in two parts. One is a logger program that prepares the runtime environment to inject, load, and execute a monitored binary program. The other is a shared object that can be injected into a program by the logger using **LD_PRELOAD**. You have to dump the library calls as well as the passed parameters and the returned values. Please check the "Requirements" section for more details.  

The output of your homework is required to follow the spec strictly. The TAs will use the **diff** tool to compare the output of your program against the correct answer. When comparing the outputs, continuous spaces and tabs in the output are merged into a single space character.

## Requirements

#### Program Arguments
Your program should work with the following arguments:
```bash
usage: ./logger [-o file] [-p sopath] [--] cmd [cmd args ...]
    -p: set the path to logger.so, default = ./logger.so
    -o: print output to file, print to "stderr" if no file specified
    --: separate the arguments for logger and for the command
```
If an invalid argument is passed to the logger, the above message should be displayed.

#### Monitored file access activities

The list of monitored library calls is shown below. It covers several functions we have introduced in the class.  

**1. chmod**   
**2. chown**   
**3. close**   
**4. creat**   
**5. fclose**   
**6. fopen**   
**7. fread**   
**8. fwrite**   
**9. open**   
**10. read**   
**11. remove**   
**12. rename**   
**13. tmpfile**   
**14. write**  

#### Output

You have to dump the library calls as well as the corresponding parameters and the return value. We have several special rules for printing out function arguments and return values:
- If a passed argument is a filename string, print the real absolute path of the file by using realpath(3). If realpath(3) cannot resolve the filename string, simply print out the string untouched.
- If a passed argument is a descriptor or a FILE * pointer, print the absolute path of the corresponding file. The filename for a corresponding descriptor can be found in /proc/{pid}/fd directory.
- If a passed argument is a mode or a flag, print out the value in octal.
- If a passed argument is an integer, simply print out the value in decimal.
- If a passed argument is a regular character buffer, print it out up to 32 bytes. Check each output character using isprint(3) function and output a dot '.' if a character is not printable.
- If a return value is an integer, simply print out the value in decimal.
- If a return value is a pointer, print out it using %p format conversion specifier.
- Output strings should be quoted with double quotes.

A sample output of the homework is given below. More examples can be found in the "Sample Output" section.
```bash
$ ./logger ./sample
[logger] creat("/home/ta/hw2/tmp/aaaa", 600) = 3
[logger] chmod("/home/ta/hw2/tmp/aaaa", 666) = 0
[logger] chown("/home/ta/hw2/tmp/aaaa", 65534, 65534) = -1
[logger] rename("/home/ta/hw2/tmp/aaaa", "/home/ta/hw2/tmp/bbbb") = 0
[logger] open("/home/ta/hw2/tmp/bbbb", 1101, 666) = 4
[logger] write("/home/ta/hw2/tmp/bbbb", "cccc.", 5) = 5
[logger] close("/home/ta/hw2/tmp/bbbb") = 0
[logger] open("/home/ta/hw2/tmp/bbbb", 000, 000) = 4
[logger] read("/home/ta/hw2/tmp/bbbb", "cccc.", 100) = 5
[logger] close("/home/ta/hw2/tmp/bbbb") = 0
[logger] tmpfile() = 0x55c418842670
[logger] fwrite("cccc.", 1, 5, "/tmp/#14027911 (deleted)") = 5

[logger] fopen("/home/ta/hw2/tmp/bbbb", "r") = 0x55c418842670
[logger] fread("cccc.", 1, 100, "/home/ta/hw2/tmp/bbbb") = 5
[logger] fclose("/home/ta/hw2/tmp/bbbb") = 0
[logger] remove("/home/ta/hw2/tmp/bbbb") = 0
sample done.
[logger] write("/dev/pts/19", "sample done...", 14) = 14
```

## Sample Output
Some basic usage.
```bash
$ ./logger
no command given.

$ ./logger -h                
./logger: invalid option -- 'h'
usage: ./logger [-o file] [-p sopath] [--] cmd [cmd args ...]
        -p: set the path to logger.so, default = ./logger.so
        -o: print output to file, print to "stderr" if no file specified
        --: separate the arguments for logger and for the command

$ ./logger ls                
[logger] fopen("/proc/filesystems", "re") = 0x55aa12cd6ad0
[logger] fclose("/proc/filesystems") = 0
hw2.c  logger  logger.so  Makefile  sample  sample.c  sample.txt
[logger] fclose("/dev/pts/7") = 0
[logger] fclose("/dev/pts/7") = 0

$ ./logger ls 2>/dev/null 
hw2.c  logger  logger.so  Makefile  sample  sample.c  sample.txt

$ ./logger -o ls_al.txt -- ls -al
... [output of `ls -al`] ...

$ cat ls_al.txt       
[logger] fopen("/proc/filesystems", "re") = 0x558c872fcad0
[logger] fclose("/proc/filesystems") = 0
[logger] fopen("/etc/passwd", "rme") = 0x558c872fcd00
[logger] fclose("/etc/passwd") = 0
[logger] fopen("/etc/group", "rme") = 0x558c872fcf30
[logger] fclose("/etc/group") = 0

[logger] close("/etc/bash.bashrc") = 0
...
[logger] read("/dev/pts/7", "l", 1) = 1
[logger] fwrite("l", 1, 1, "/dev/pts/7") = 1
[logger] read("/dev/pts/7", "s", 1) = 1
[logger] fwrite("s", 1, 1, "/dev/pts/7") = 1

[logger] fclose("/proc/filesystems") = 0
[logger] fclose("/dev/pts/7") = 0
...
```

## Hints
When implementing your homework, you may inspect symbols used by an executable. We have mentioned that you cannot see any symbols if they were symbol stripped (using strip command). However, you may consider working with the readelf command. For example, we can check the symbols that are unknown to the binary:

```bash
$ nm /usr/bin/wget
nm: /usr/bin/wget: no symbols
$ readelf --syms /usr/bin/wget | grep open
    72: 0000000000000000     0 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT  UND freopen64@GLIBC_2.2.5 (2)
    73: 0000000000000000     0 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT  UND iconv_open@GLIBC_2.2.5 (2)
   103: 0000000000000000     0 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT  UND gzdopen
   107: 0000000000000000     0 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT  UND fdopen@GLIBC_2.2.5 (2)
   119: 0000000000000000     0 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT  UND open64@GLIBC_2.2.5 (2)
   201: 0000000000000000     0 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT  UND fopen64@GLIBC_2.2.5 (2)
```

Alternatively, you may consider using **nm -D** to read symbols. Basically, we have two different symbol tables. One is the regular symbol table, and the other is the dynamic symbol table. The one removed by **strip** is the regular symbol table. So you will need to work with **nm -D** or **readelf --syms** to read the dynamic symbol table.
