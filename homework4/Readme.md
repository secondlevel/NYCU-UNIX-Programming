# Simplified Scriptable Instruction Level Debugger

In this homework, you have to implement a simple instruction-level debugger that allows a user to debug a program interactively at the assembly instruction level. You can implement the debugger by using the ptrace interface. The commands you have to implement are summarized as follows:

```bash
- break {instruction-address}: add a break point
- cont: continue execution
- delete {break-point-id}: remove a break point
- disasm addr: disassemble instructions in a file or a memory region
- dump addr: dump memory content
- exit: terminate the debugger
- get reg: get a single value from a register
- getregs: show registers
- help: show this message
- list: list break points
- load {path/to/a/program}: load a program
- run: run the program
- vmmap: show memory layout
- set reg val: get a single value to a register
- si: step into instruction
- start: start the program and stop at the first instruction
```

In a debugging process, you have to load a program first, configure the debugger, and start debugging by running the program. A debugger command may be only used in certain "states." The states include **any**, **not loaded**, **loaded**, and **running**. State any means that a command can be used at any time. State **not loaded** means that a command can only be used when a program is not loaded. State **loaded** means that a command can only be used when a program is loaded. State **running** means that a command can only be used when the program is running. The following is the state flow chart.

</p>

The details of each command are explained below. We use brackets right after a command to enclose the list of the state(s) that the command should support.

- **break or b [running]**: Setup a break point. If a program is loaded but is not running, you can simply display an error message. When a break point is hit, you have to output a message and indicate the corresponding address and instruction. The address of the break point should be within the range specified by the text segment in the ELF file and will not be the same as the entry point.
- **cont** or **c [running]**: continue the execution when a running program is stopped (suspended).
- **delete [running]**: remove a break point. Please remember to handle illegal situations, like deleting non-existing break points.
- **disasm** or **d [running]**: Disassemble instructions in a file or a memory region. The address of each instruction should be within the range specified by the text segment in the ELF file. You only have to dump 10 instructions for each command. If **disasm** command is executed without an address, you can simply output ** no addr is given. Please note that the output should not have the machine code cc. See the demonstration section for the sample output format.
- **dump** or **x [running]**: Dump memory content. You only have to dump 80 bytes from a given address. The output contains the addresses, the hex values, and printable ASCII characters. If dump command is executed without an address, you can simply output ** no addr is given. Please note that the output should include the machine code cc if there is a break point.
- **exit** or **q [any]**: Quit from the debugger. The program being debugged should be killed as well.
- **get** or **g [running]**: Get the value of a register. Register names are all in lowercase.
- **getregs [running]**: Get the value of all registers.
- **help** or **h [any]**: Show the help message.
- **list** or **l [any]**: List break points, which contains index numbers (for deletion) and addresses.
- **load [not loaded]**: Load a program into the debugger. When a program is loaded, you have to print out the address of entry point.
- **run** or **r [loaded and running]**: Run the program. If the program is already running, show a warning message and continue the execution. If the program is loaded, start the program and continue the execution.
- **vmmap** or **m [running]**: Show memory layout for a running program. If a program is not running, you can simply display an error message. The memory layout is:
```bash
[address] [perms] [offset] [pathname]
```
  Check the demonstration section for the sample output format.
- **set** or **s [running]**: Set the value of a register
- **si [running]**: Run a single instruction, and step into function calls.
- **start [loaded]**: Start the program and stop at the first instruction.

#### Your program may output some debug messages. In that case, please add "**" prefixes before your message. We will remove lines beginning with "**" when comparing outputs.

Your program should read user commands from either user inputs (by default) or a predefined script (if -s option is given). Please check the demonstration section for the sample input and the corresponding output for more details about the implementation. The usage of this homework is:

```bash
usage: ./hw4 [-s script] [program]
```

## Demonstration
We use the hello world and the guess.nopie program introduced in the class to demonstrate the usage of the simple debugger. User typed commands are marked in blue.

## Sample Scripts (30%)
### # Sample scripts passed to your homework (with -s option) can be found here!
Please note that the debugger is exited directly after the script is executed.

 - [hello1.txt](https://people.cs.nctu.edu.tw/~chuang/courses/unixprog/resources/hw4_sdb/scripts/hello1.txt) (6%)
 - [hello2.txt](https://people.cs.nctu.edu.tw/~chuang/courses/unixprog/resources/hw4_sdb/scripts/hello2.txt) (6%)
 - [hello3.txt](https://people.cs.nctu.edu.tw/~chuang/courses/unixprog/resources/hw4_sdb/scripts/hello3.txt) (6%)
 - [hello4.txt](https://people.cs.nctu.edu.tw/~chuang/courses/unixprog/resources/hw4_sdb/scripts/hello4.txt) (6%)
 - [guess.txt](https://people.cs.nctu.edu.tw/~chuang/courses/unixprog/resources/hw4_sdb/scripts/guess.txt) (6%)

Two examples of running scripts are given as follows.
#1. Print 'hello, world!' for three times.
```bash
$ ./hw4 -s scripts/hello3.txt 2>&1 | grep -v '^\*\*'
hello, world!
rip = 4194502 (0x4000c6)
hello, world!
rip = 4194502 (0x4000c6)
hello, world!
$
```

#2. Auto debugger for guess
```bash
$ ./hw4 -s scripts/guess.txt sample/guess.nopie 2>&1 | grep -v '^\*\*'
1234
rax = 1234 (0x4d2)
rdx = 580655839 (0x229c1adf)
Show me the key: Bingo!
$
```

### Hints
Here we provide some hints for implementing this homework.  
  For disassembling, you have to link against the [capstone](http://www.capstone-engine.org/) library. You may refer to the official capstone [C tutorial](https://www.capstone-engine.org/lang_c.html) or the ptrace slide for the usage.
